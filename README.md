# Tic-Tac-Toe: Hell on Earth

Welcome to **Tic-Tac-Toe: Hell on Earth**, a simple yet fiendishly challenging console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. The game features a relentless AI opponent that is designed to be unbeatable, making this a test of your wits, patience, and perhaps your sanity!

## üéÆ Gameplay

The game follows the traditional rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:
- The game board is a 3x3 grid, represented in the console as shown below:
    ```
    |---|---|---|
    | 1 | 2 | 3 |
    |-----------|
    | 4 | 5 | 6 |
    |-----------|
    | 7 | 8 | 9 |
    |---|---|---|
    ```
- Players take turns to place their mark (X) on the board by entering the number corresponding to the desired position (1-9).
- The AI opponent, represented by (O), will then take its turn.
- The game continues until the board is full, ending either in a draw or with the AI claiming victory.

## ü§ñ Unbeatable AI

The AI in this game is programmed to be invincible. It's so challenging that the difficulty level is aptly named **"Hell on Earth"**. No matter how clever you think you are, the AI will always find a way to avoid defeat. The best outcome you can hope for is a draw.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Console-Based Interface**: The game runs entirely in the console, making it lightweight and easy to play on any system with a C++ compiler.
- **AI Opponent**: The AI is built to never lose, ensuring a consistent and formidable challenge.
- **Single Difficulty Level**: The game only offers one difficulty level, "Hell on Earth," reflecting the impossibility of defeating the AI.

## üéØ How to Play

After launching the game, the Tic-Tac-Toe board will be displayed in the console. To make a move, enter the number corresponding to the position on the board where you want to place your X. The AI will then take its turn, placing an O on the board. The game alternates turns until either a draw occurs, or the AI wins.

## ‚ú® Future Enhancements
This project was created as a simple and fun challenge, but potential future enhancements could include:

- Adding different difficulty levels (but what fun would that be)
- Implementing a two-player mode (user makes turn instead of AI)
- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI)
